# K-Means Clustering

This repository contains a K-Means model written in Python. K-Means partitions data into clusters. We start by (1) initializing positions of some centroids, then (2) create clusters by assigning data points to their nearest centroid, and lastly (3) optimize the centroid positions by moving them towards the center of their group. See figure 1 for a demonstration.

## Testing

Required packages: NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib

Test the model by navigating to the directory in your terminal and type,

```bash
python experiment.py
```
